# AI-Powered-IT-Service-Desk-Ticket-Intelligence-Platform
An AI-driven ITSM system that automates ticket classification, similarity search, resolution suggestions, and IT summaries using AWS serverless architecture and LLMs.

This project implements an end-to-end AI-enabled IT Service Management (ITSM) platform where users can raise support tickets, automatically classify issues using NLP, retrieve similar historical cases, and generate AI-based resolution guidance and IT summaries. The system is built using AWS Lambda, Bedrock (LLM), vector embeddings, and a Streamlit UI for real-time interaction.

It covers:

Intelligent ticket classification (ML + embeddings)

Semantic similarity search on past incidents

AI-generated resolution recommendations

AI-generated IT operational summaries

Admin and User portals with analytics
